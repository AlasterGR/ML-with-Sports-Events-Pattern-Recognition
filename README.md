# ML-with-Sports-Events-Pattern-Recognition
MATLab Code, documentation and images of Machine Learning on Pattern Recognition for predicting the outcomes of football matches.

This repository contains code and documentation for the analysis and prediction of sports events using machine learning algorithms. The project focuses on applying machine learning techniques, particularly neural networks, for predicting the outcomes of football matches based on various team attributes and betting odds.

# Key Features:  
Implementation of linear and multilayer neural network classifiers for match outcome prediction.  
Analysis of team attributes and betting odds data from the provided SQLite database.  
Evaluation of classifier accuracy using 10-fold cross-validation methodology.  
Exploration of sports event patterns and trends through machine learning techniques.

Technologies Used:  
MATLAB for implementation.  
SQLite for data storage and retrieval.
